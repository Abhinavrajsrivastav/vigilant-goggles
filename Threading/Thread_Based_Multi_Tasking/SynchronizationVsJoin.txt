Synchronization ensures that only one thread can access a critical section of code (or shared resource) 
at a time, preventing simultaneous access by multiple threads. 
This prevents data corruption or inconsistency caused by concurrent access. 
However, synchronization does not inherently dictate the order in which threads execute; 
it merely enforces mutual exclusion to maintain data integrity.


On the other hand, the join() method is used to coordinate the order of execution among 
multiple threads. It allows one thread to wait for another thread to complete its task before
proceeding further. This ensures that the execution of one thread is completed before the
next one starts, thus controlling the flow of execution in a multithreaded program.
